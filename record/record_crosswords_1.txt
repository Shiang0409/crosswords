input: An agendum; something to be done: planx
Evaluator response: The letter constraint is: 5 letters, no specific letter requirement.
Some possible words that mean "An agendum; something to be done":
schedule (s c h e d u l e): 7 letters, not 5
plan (p l a n): 4 letters, not 5
I cannot think of any word now with the pattern planx that means "An agendum; something to be done". It's likely impossible due to the lack of specific constraints.

action (a c t i o n): 7 letters, not 5

input: To stir up; to remove from office: awake
Evaluator response: The letter constraint is: 5 letters, no specific letters mentioned.
Some possible words that mean "To stir up":
rouse (r o u s e): 5 letters, not exactly the same meaning but close
stir (s t i r): 4 letters, not 5
wake (w a k e): 4 letters, not 5
I cannot think of any words now. The given word "awake" does not fit the constraints mentioned (to stir up; to remove from office), so this is impossible.

Some possible words that mean "A gadget":

Evaluator response: The letter constraint is not given for this example. There seems no specific pattern required.
