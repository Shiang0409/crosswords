I can think of apple, which is a five-letter word related to doing or including in an agenda. However, it doesn't mean exactly "An agendum; something to be done". So, the word may fit but the meaning may not be perfect.

There are words that fit the meaning but don't match the letter count or constraints (e.g., agenda). However, "apple" can be considered as a five-letter word with some meaning ("a small round fruit"), fitting the letter count and has nothing to do with the given meanings. So, it is not impossible.

input: Not ever: let__
Evaluator response: The letter constraint is: 5 letters, letter 1 is l, letter 3 is e, letter 4 is t.
Some possible words that mean "Not ever":
never (n e v e r): 5 letters, letter 2 is n, not l
I cannot think of any words now. 4 letters are constrained, and it is extremely unlikely to have a word with pattern let__ to mean "Not ever"

Evaluator response: The letter constraint is: 5 letters, letter 1 is e, letter 2 is m.
Some possible words that mean "Drenched; drowned":

flooded (f l u u d): 6 letters, not 5
I cannot think of any words now. 2 letters are constrained, and _ ems__ seems a common pattern for some negative emotions

input: An agendum; something to be done: apple
Evaluator response: The letter constraint is: 5 letters, no specific letter constraints.
Some possible words that mean "An agendum; something to be done":
task (t a s k): 4 letters, not 5
goal (g o a l): 4 letters, not 5
apple (a p p l e): 5 letters, not related to "an agendum" or "something to be done".
impossible (in the context of letter constraints) but possible in general, just needs better word selection. However, 'task' and 'goal' are also good options under the given letter constraint.
